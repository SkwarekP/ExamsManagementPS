This React Application has been created to learn and explore machine state with redux. 
It presents the examination process mainly related to knowledge of programming languages.

Nowadays I develop that app adding new features depends what actually comes to my mind.

I'm searching for contributors who would help me with backend part (I'm using firebase at the moment).
